# Auto-Commit After Save

After saving files or completing edits, automatically commit the changes unless:

1. **There are other pending tasks** - If the user has asked for multiple things or there are incomplete todos, finish those first
2. **The user explicitly asks not to commit** - Respect explicit instructions to skip committing
3. **There are no changes to commit** - Only commit when there are actual file changes

## Commit Behavior

- **When to commit**: After successfully saving/editing files and completing the requested task
- **Commit message**: Use descriptive commit messages based on what was changed (e.g., "Add pre-commit hook", "Update component styling", "Fix bug in authentication")
- **What to commit**: Only commit files that were actually modified as part of the current task
- **Pre-commit hook**: The pre-commit hook will automatically run `npm run build` - if it fails, the commit will be blocked

## Examples

✅ **Good - Commit after completing task:**
- User: "Add a button component"
- Action: Create button component, then commit with message "Add button component"

✅ **Good - Complete other tasks first:**
- User: "Fix the bug and also update the docs"
- Action: Fix bug, update docs, THEN commit both changes together

❌ **Don't commit if:**
- User explicitly says "don't commit yet"
- There are incomplete todos or pending tasks
- No files were actually changed
