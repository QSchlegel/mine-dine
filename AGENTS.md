# Agent Guidelines

## Commits

- **Do not** always add the Cursor co-author trailer to commits. Avoid appending `--trailer "Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>"` (or similar) to every commit. Add co-author trailers only when the user explicitly requests it or when it's clearly appropriate.
